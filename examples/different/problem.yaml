# OUTPUT VALIDATOR OPTIONS
#
# There is a relatively versatile default validator available that is
# sufficient for most problems.  If the problem needs a custom output
# validator, the validation field should be set to "custom".  The
# validator_flags field is just a list of command line arguments that
# are passed on to the validator program used (whether it be the
# default validator or a custom validator).

# DESCRIPTION OF DEFAULT VALIDATOR OPTIONS
#
# The default validator is essentially a beefed-up diff. In its default
# mode, it tokenizes the two files and compares token by token. It
# supports the following command-line arguments to control how tokens
# are compared.
#
#  o case_sensitive
#       indicates that comparisons should be case-sensitive
#  o space_change_sensitive
#       indicates that changes in the amount of whitespace should
#       be rejected (the de- fault is that any sequence of 1 or more
#       whitespace characters are equivalent).
#  o float_relative_tolerance eps
#       indicates that floating-point tokens should be accepted if
#       they are within relative error <= eps
#  o float_absolute_tolerance eps
#       indicates that floating-point tokens should be accepted if
#       they are within absolute error <= eps
#  o float_tolerance eps
#       short-hand for applying eps as both relative and absolute
#       tolerance.
#
# Note that when supplying both a relative and an absolute tolerance,
# the semantics are that a token is accepted if it is within either of
# the two tolerances.
#
# When a floating-point tolerance has been set, any valid formatting
# of floating point numbers is accepted for floating point tokens. So
# for instance if a token in the answer file says 0.0314, a token of
# 3.14000000e-2 in the output file would be accepted (but note that
# this applies *only* to floating point tokens, so "2.0e2" would *not*
# be a correct output if the answer file says "200"). If no floating
# point tolerance has been set, floating point tokens are treated just
# like any other token and has to match exactly.
