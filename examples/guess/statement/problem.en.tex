\problemname{Guess the Number}

I am thinking of a number between $1$ and $1000$, can you guess what
number it is?  Given a guess, I will tell you whether the guess is too
low, too high, or correct.  But I will only give you $10$ guesses, so
use them wisely!

\section*{Interaction}

Your program should output guesses for the correct number, in the form
of an integer between $1$ and $1000$ on a line on its own.  After
making each guess, you need to make sure to flush standard out.

After each guess, there will be a response to be read from standard
in.  This response is a line with one of the following three words:
\begin{itemize}
\item ``\texttt{lower}'' if the number I am thinking of is lower than your guess
\item ``\texttt{higher}'' if the number I am thinking of is higher than your guess
\item ``\texttt{correct}'' if your guess is correct
\end{itemize}
After having guessed the right answer your program should exit.  If
you guess incorrectly $10$ times, you won't get any more chances and
your program will be terminated.
