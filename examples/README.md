# Example problem packages

These are a few examples of complete problems.

## different

This is a basic problem that asks for a program that computes
the difference between integers.  It should be a good starting point
if you want to learn how the problem format works.

## guess

This is a simple example of an *interactive* problem where there is
no fixed input to process, but the solution instead communicates back
and forth with a validator program.

## hello

This is a problem that just asks for a program that prints `Hello
World!`.  It is a somewhat atypical problem since it does not have any
input.  This problem also illustrates having problem statements in
more than one language.

## oddecho

This is an example of a *scoring* problem where submissions can get
different scores depending on which test groups they solve. It also demonstrates how an input validator might check different constraints for different test groups. The swedish statement showcases how to use images, footnotes
and tables in Markdown.
