# Example problem packages

These are a few examples of complete problems.

## different

This is a basic problem that asks for a program that computes
the difference between integers.  It should be a good starting point
if you want to learn how the problem format works.

## guess

This is a simple example of an *interactive* problem where there is
no fixed input to process, but the solution instead communicates back
and forth with a validator program.

## hello

This is a problem that just asks for a program that prints `Hello
World!`.  It is a somewhat atypical problem since it does not have any
input.  This problem also illustrates having problem statements in
more than one language.

## oddecho

This is an example of a *scoring* problem where submissions can get
different scores depending on which test groups they solve. It also demonstrates how an input validator might check different constraints for different test groups.
