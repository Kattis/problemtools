\problemname{Checkers}

You are to write a program that plays checkers agains another program. First, you are sent either X or O on standard in. The player sent an X begins. If you go first, you are to output the square where you wish to place your token. Then, you will be sent your opponents move on stdin. A move is indicated by two coordinates, $0\leq x\leq 2$ and $0\leq y\leq 2$, where $x$ is the column and $y$ is the row where you want to place your mark. If you go second, you first get sent a move, and are then expected to make a move. This goes on until one player has won. When you win, you get sent "you won". If you lose, you get sent "you lose". Dont forget to flush stdout!
